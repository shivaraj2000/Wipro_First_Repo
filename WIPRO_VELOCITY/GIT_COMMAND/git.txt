-------------------------------------------


1. To create a new local repository:

Let’s create a directory for repository.

mkdir repo
cd repo

use following command to create repository

git init	

It creates a .git directory that contains all the Git-related information for your project.

---
2. Create new file file1.txt and file2.txt in repo directory and run following command to check status.

git status

Status command displays a list the files you’ve changed and those you still need to add or commit.
---

3. Adding files:

Create files and give git add command

Run following command to add both files:

git add file1.txt file2.txt
---
4. Commit:

After staging files, we can commit them into Git. Run following command to commit:

git commit -m "First commit"

m for commit message.

you can use -a to commit any files you’ve added with git add, and also commit any files you’ve changed since then.

git commit -a
---

5. Further Commits:

Let’s modify file1.txt after first commit. Now to check the changes from the last commit, run following command:

git diff

---

6.  To check the history of your project, run the following command:

git log

---



7. To put code on remote server using push command:

You could create a project on GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket and push your existing code to the repository. 
Conveniently, a remote to which you have write access is called the origin.

Run following commands to add a remote origin and then push the code to the origin.

git remote add origin https://github.com/sagar4java/gitsample -- gitsample is a new repository name in github
git push -u origin master

Push command is used to send changes to remote repository.

Let’s create a new branch “branch1” and switch on it

git checkout -b branch1
Modify file2.txt manually then check status and commit it.

git status
git commit -am "Branch1 first commit"
To push the branch to your remote repository, so others can use it:

git branch

---
